	 * 1. What does JPA stand for? Why is it useful? What problems does it solve?
	 * 
	 * ANSWER:
	 * JPA stands for Java Persistence API. It simplifies database interaction in Java, offering a standardized way to handle data persistence. 
	 * JPA solves problems by abstracting database complexities, reducing boilerplate code, ensuring portability, and providing consistent transaction management. 
	 * 
	 * 2. Compare JDBC & JPA.  Compare and contrast the two approaches.
	 * 
	 * ANSWER:
	 * Comparing Spring JSBC to Spring JPA. Firstly they both are built on top of Java JDBC. 
	 * 
	 * 3. Why and where would using logging be useful?  What library do we use in this course for logging?  
	 * 
	 * ANSWER:
	 * Logging plays a crucial role in software development and production environments for various reasons. It aids in debugging and troubleshooting 
	 * during development, providing insights into code execution and helping identify issues. In production, logging becomes essential for diagnosing problems, 
	 * monitoring application health, and maintaining a historical record of events. Whether in continuous integration pipelines, distributed systems, 
	 * or security monitoring, logging is versatile. In this course, the chosen logging library is SLF4J (Simple Logging Facade for Java), 
	 * known for its abstraction layer that allows flexibility in using different logging implementations, enhancing configurability, and 
	 * promoting a streamlined developer experience. 
	 * 
	 * 4. What is Lombok?  How is it used?  What benefits come from using Lombok?
	 * 
	 * ANSWER:
	 * Lombok is a performance enhancement library, it helps reduce the amount of boiler plate code we need to write to get the job done. 
	 * Some of the basics use annotations like @data, which creates getters and setters we can use for the class. And we never have to actually 
	 * write/code the getters and setters. 
	 * 
	 * The benefit is it speeds up our development time. We are focused on the unique aspects of our application instead of write that same
	 * boiler code over and over.
