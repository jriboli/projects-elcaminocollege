	 * 4. What is Lombok?  How is it used?  What benefits come from using Lombok?
	 * 
	 * ANSWER:
	 * Lombok is a performance enhancement library, it helps reduce the amount of boiler plate code we need to write to get the job done. 
	 * Some of the basics use annotations like @data, which creates getters and setters we can use for the class. And we never have to actually 
	 * write/code the getters and setters. 
	 * 
	 * The benefit is it speeds up our development time. We are focused on the unique aspects of our application instead of write that same
	 * boiler code over and over.
