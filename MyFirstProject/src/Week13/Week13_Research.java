	 * 1. How do web APIs work? Why are they useful?
	 * 
	 * ANSWER:
	 * Web APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are a set of rules and protocols that allow different software applications to 
	 * communicate and interact with each other over the web. They serve as a bridge between different systems, enabling them to 
	 * exchange data and functionality in a standardized and efficient manner. 
	 * 
	 * 2. Look up 3 different public web APIs online and describe 3 endpoints from each.  
	 * 	In your description include the following:
	 * (a) The URI (or endpoint)
	 * (b) All of the HTTP verb methods that can be sent to that endpoint.
	 * (c) A description of what happens when each verb method is sent.
	 * 
	 * ANSWER:
	 * 1. GitHub API (REST API v3):
	 * (a) User Information Endpoint:
	 * URI: https://api.github.com/users/{username}
	 * HTTP Verbs:
	 * 	GET: Retrieve information about a GitHub user.
	 * 	PATCH: Update information about the authenticated user.
	 * 	DELETE: Delete a user's email address.
	 * Description:
	 * 	GET: Retrieves public information about the specified GitHub user.	
	 * 	PATCH: Updates information for the authenticated user (requires authentication).
	 * 	DELETE: Deletes a specified email address from the authenticated user's profile (requires authentication).
	 * 
	 * 2. OpenWeatherMap API:
	 * (a) Current Weather Endpoint:
	 * URI: https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather
	 * HTTP Verbs:
	 * 	GET: Get current weather data for a location.
	 * Description:
	 * 	GET: Retrieves current weather data for a specified location, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more.
	 * 
	 * 3. Twitter API (Twitter Developer API):
	 * (a) User Timeline Endpoint:
	 * URI: https://api.twitter.com/2/tweets
	 * HTTP Verbs:
	 * 	GET: Retrieve recent tweets from the authenticated user's timeline.
	 * 	POST: Create a new tweet.
	 * Description:
	 * 	GET: Retrieves recent tweets from the authenticated user's timeline (requires authentication).
	 * 	POST: Creates a new tweet on the authenticated user's behalf (requires authentication).
	 * 
	 * 3. What does REST stand for?  What is REST? What are some of the key concepts that identify REST?
	 * 
	 * ANSWER: 
	 * REST stands for Representational State Transfer. It is an architectural style for designing networked applications, and
	 *  it was introduced by Roy Fielding in his doctoral dissertation in 2000. REST is not a standard but a set of principles 
	 *  and constraints that, when applied to web services, make them scalable, maintainable, and adaptable to changing requirements.
	 *  
	 * Key Concepts:
	 * 	Statelessness
	 *  Resources
	 *  Uniform Interface
	 *  Http Methods
	 *  Stateless Communication
	 *  Representation
	 *  Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State
	 * 
	 * 4. What is Maven?  Why do we use Maven? What problems does Maven help solve?
	 * 
	 * ANSWER:
	 * Maven is a powerful and widely-used build automation and project management tool for Java projects. It provides a consistent way
	 *  to manage the project's build lifecycle, dependencies, and documentation. Maven uses a declarative approach, allowing developers
	 *  to describe the structure and dependencies of their projects in a concise and standardized manner.
	 * 
	 * 5. What is Swagger?  Why would you use Swagger?  What can be done with Swagger?
	 * 
	 * ANSWER:
	 * Swagger is a framework for designing, documenting, and testing APIs. It provides a standardized way to describe RESTful APIs, 
	 * making it easier for developers to understand and interact with the API.
	 * 
	 * What can be done with Swagger:
	 * API Documentation
	 * Design API
	 * Testing
	 * Code Generation
	 * Standardization
	 * Integration
	 * 
	 * 6. What is ARC?  Why would you use ARC?  What can you do with ARC?
	 * 
	 * ANSWER:
	 * 
	 * 7. What is Postman?  Why would you use Postman?  What can be done with Postman?
	 * 
	 * ANSWER:
	 * Postman is a popular collaboration platform for API development. It provides a user-friendly interface that simplifies
	 *  the process of designing, testing, and documenting APIs. Postman is widely used by developers, testers, and API providers
	 *  to streamline API development workflows.
	 *  
	 * What can be done with Postman:
	 * API Testing
	 * API Design
	 * Request Building
	 * Automation
	 * Collections and Environments
	 * Collaboration
	 * Monitoring
	 * Documentation
	 * Mock Servers
